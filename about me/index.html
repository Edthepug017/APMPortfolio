    <p><strong>About Me</strong><br></p>
    Hi, my name is Alex McMicken. I attend Skyline Highschool located in Salt Lake City Utah, I play for their club hockey team as their goalie. I'm hoping to play for the Skyline lacrosse team in the spring. Currently this website has been my challenge in school, I've been working on this through Dreamweaver learning code on my own slowly. Along with playing Skyline hockey as a Sophmore, I  play for the Utah Jr. Grizzlies U16/U18 team. We are a travel team playing in tournements around the United States of America. I have won State Championships in U14, went second in State Championships my second year of U14, before that I played for the Salt Lake Stars (now known as the Utah Stars) we went second in State in summer league, I have played in National Championships and went seventh in the nation. The second year of U14 when I went second in State Chapionships I was assistant captian of my team. I know alot of my About Me page is mostly hockey because for the last 11 years of my 15 year life so far has been hockey, my life revolves around hockey. I plan on going to the University of Utah or UCLA for their hockey programs, and the University of Utah has one of the best graphic programs in the country.
